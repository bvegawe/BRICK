This repository contains the models and analyses to produce the
“Sea-level projections representing deeply uncertain ice-sheet contributions”

It contains the sub-models
- DOECLIM
- dais
- simple
- GSIC-MAGICC
- delayedlinear (TE)
- WAIScollapse

This code of this repository will also be used to build BRICK from
BRICK will be organized differently with the code divided by language
fortran, R and julia

Note that the codes here ("robustslr" branch) will reproduce that work, but the 
"latest and greatest" BRICK model codes are available through the master branch.

./calibration/          R scripts related to the (pre-/post-)calibration of the
                        physical models, including reading data, likelihood
                        functions, and sub-model stand-alone calibration drivers
                        (some of these may be antiquated)
./data/                 data for radiative forcing (DOECLIM) and calibration
./fortran/              Fortran versions of all physical models are available,
                        and are wrapped in R calling functions in ./fortran/R/
./output_model/         physical model output (i.e., temperature, sea-level rise)
./output_calibration/   statistical model output (i.e., posterior parameter values)
./R/                    physical models in R
./Useful/               a couple useful routines

/calibration/README_calibration
                        describes the MCMC approach to calibrate the rest of the
                        physical models in a coupled setting

To reproduce the results of Bakker et al:

1. Open R
2. Go to the ‘calibration’ directory (setwd(…))
3. Run ./calibration/BRICK_calib_driver.R (with modifications to the script; see
   README_calibration and the paper)
4. Run ./calibration/DAIS_calib_driver.R (with modifications to the script; see
   README_calibration_DAIS and the paper)
5. Run ./calibration/processing_pipeline.R (modify to fit your file names and
   directory names; n.ensemble=50000)
6. Run ./calibration/plots_and_analysis.R (modify to fit your file names and 
   directory names).
