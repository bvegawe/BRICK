This repository contains the models and analyses to produce the results of 
‘Impacts of Antarctic Fast Dynamics on Sea-Level Projections and Coastal Flood Defense’

It contains the sub-models
- DOECLIM (ocean diffusion, energy balance)
- DAIS/DAIS-FD (Antarctic ice sheet/AIS+fast dynamics)
- SIMPLE (Greenland ice sheet)
- GSIC-MAGICC (glaciers and small ice caps)
- delayedlinear (TE) (thermal expansion)

Workflow of Wong et al (2016):
1. Calibrate DAIS using paleoclimatic data (./calibration/DAISfastdyn_calib_driver.R)
2. Calibrate rest of the physical model using modern data (./calibration/BRICK_calib_driver.R)
3. Combine in post-calibration to modern sea-level rise data and van Dantzig analysis
	-> modify settings in ./calibration/processingPipline_fastdyn.R
	-> then run the script
4. Plots and analysis 
	-> modify settings in ./calibration/analysis_and_plots_fastdyn.R
	-> then run the script

Any questions or comments?
