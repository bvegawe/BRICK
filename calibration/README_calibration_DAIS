To obtain calibrated parameters for the Antarctic Ice Sheet model (DAIS),
including accounting for the AIS fast dynamics, the following routines are required:

in /calibration/
  DAISfastdyn_calib_driver.R     driver script for the MCMC calibration of DAIS
  DAIS_readData.R         script to read the Antarctic data (Shaffer (2014))
  DAIS_assimLikelihood.R  likelihood functions for MCMC

in /R/
  anto.R                  model to estimate Antarctic ocean subsurface temperature
                          from the global temperature anomalies

in /fortran/              (see /fortran/README for more information)
  dais.so                 dynamic library for the DAIS model Fortran version
  /R/daisantoF.R          R wrapper function around the Fortran model, including
                          anto for the ocean subsurface temperature
  /R/daisanto_fastdynF.R  DAIS physical model, with fast dynamics

Following the commands in DAISfastdyn_calib_driver.R will result in calibrated DAIS
and anto model parameters, written by default into a file

  ../output_calibration/DAISfastdyn_calibratedParameters_[uniform/gamma]_[date-stamp].nc

Each row is a different concomitant parameter set for the DAIS(anto) model. Each
column is a different model parameter.

By default, the model is set up to calibrate the anto.a and anto.b parameters,
which are for regressing Antarctic ocean subsurface temperature (input to DAIS)
on global temperature anomalies (output from DOECLIM). If you are only interested
in running stand-alone DAIS (e.g., Ruckert et al (2016) or Shaffer (2014)), then
use "Toc" from /data/future_TO.txt for the ocean temperatures (Shaffer (2014)).

The Antarctic ice sheet model (DAIS) was calibrated using Antarctic sea
level reconstructions in the same method as Shaffer (2014) and Ruckert et al
(2016), and an additional calibration window was added, using the IPCC AR5
(Ch 13, p 1151) AIS SLR trend. The Last Interglacial Period window (118,000 years
ago) was from DeConto and Pollard (2016).

================================================================================
A couple notes about the calibration:
  * The calibration method is a robust adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo
    algorithm (RAM-MCMC), and is described well in Vihola (2012),
    doi:10.1007/s11222-011-9269-5.
  * Getting about 500,000 iterations is typically enough. This requires ~10 hours
    on a typical modern multi-core laptop computer, and can be run in parallel
    with minimum overhead cost for parallelization onto multiple physical cores,
    and slightly more overhead cost for parallelization onto multiple threads
    within a core.
  * To check how many physical cores your machine has, run in R:
      detectCores(logical=FALSE)
  * To check how many logical cores (accounts for multi-threading), run:
      detectCores(logical=TRUE)
  * It is safe to assume that for ~100,000 or more (reasonable MCMC lengths)
    iterations, it is worth it to run parallel chains. This provides:
      (1) additional posterior samples at little additional computational cost
      (2) more robust Gelman and Rubin convergence statistics (for when
          inter-chain variability ~ intra-chain variability)
    but unfortunately you do not get a progress bar, and adding samples to a
    parallel MCMC object cannot be done in parallel. So estimate how many samples
    you will need and how long it will take ahead of time.

  * To re-create the results of Wong et al (2016), run DAISfastdyn_calib_driver.R using:
	- niter.mcmc=5e5
	- use the MCMC.parallel(…) command with n.cpu=4
	- burnin=3e5
	- set fd.priors to either ‘u’ or ‘g’ for uniform or gamma priors on the
	  fast dynamics parameters
